# Rock Paper Scissors App

# Overview

For this project, I wanted to learn Kotlin. However, I didn't just want to learn Kotlin, I wanted to learn it to be able to create an app for Androids.  That being said,
I kept the logic to my program rather basic, and took more time to get integrated with Android Studio, and a lot of the xml that is used in there.

I wrote code to that gets input from the user (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and matched that up with a randomly generated counterpart. The logic of Rock Paper Scissors was
applied, and the user gets to see the result. The real fun in this project was getting the GUI set up for the user to interact with. For example, in every project I've
done prior to this, the input has always been received by command line. In this project, the user selects the button of their choice to pick rock, paper, or scissors.
Mapping things such as that, and traversing through different pages was the real learning experience.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Kotlin (which requires the JDK from Java), Android Studio, and an android emulator that Android Studio provided.

Kotlin is a language based heavily off Java, and is used for creating apps. Just like Java, importing libraries is very easy. For this project,
there were no downloading external libraries and adding it to the SDK's. All libraries are accepted with the default SDK's.

# Future Work

* This would be fun to be able to play with someone online, instead of just the bot.
* The audio sometimes fails on start up.
* It would be fun to include a counter of most wins in a row.
